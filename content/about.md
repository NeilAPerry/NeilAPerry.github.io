I am a PhD candidate at Stanford University, advised by [Professor Dan Boneh](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/). My research lies at the intersection of cryptography, democracy, and national security, with a focus on developing innovative solutions for complex global challenges. My commitment to enhancing free speech and promoting democracy is reflected in my development of an anonymous communication system, designed to support protesters in regimes with limited internet access, and in my creation of new steganographic techniques. These techniques are crucial for undetectable private communication, particularly in scenarios where oppressive regimes engage in censorship via altering messages.

In the sphere of national security, I have pioneered a cryptographic system for tracking tactical nuclear warheads, a project that has notably contributed to the nonproliferation initiatives of the US and NATO. I am also actively working on bolstering the security of DNA printers, addressing a critical intersection of computer science and bioengineering. With the rise of large language models (LLMs) and their potential misuse in sensitive production environments, my research also encompasses the trustworthiness and security of AI-assisted code development.

As a SETR Fellow at the Hoover Institution, my contributions extend to public policy as well. I have helped develop a comprehensive report for Congress and the White House, focusing on the implications of emerging technologies and their influence on policy. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to advise the White House on tech policy, particularly in areas relating to national security, hopefully improving our great nation.

Finally, these works were not done in isolation and I encourage you to visit my research page to see my wonderful coauthors and find out more about their accomplishments!
