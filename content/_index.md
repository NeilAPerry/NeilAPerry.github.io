I am an AI Policy Fellow at Princeton University and President of the Before Midnight Foundation. At Princeton, my research focuses on the security of AI agents, securing them and designing benchmarks to evaluate their offensive and defensive performance. The Before Midnight Foundation advances arms control by incorporating modern cryptography and security research into deployable infrastructure and policy solutions.

I received my PhD from Stanford University in 2025, advised by [Professor Dan Boneh](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/). My [dissertation](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/in00000724273) explored the intersection of cryptography, democracy, and national security, introducing new systems across three domains: anonymous communication protocols for dissidents facing censorship, treaty verification mechanisms for tracking nuclear warheads, and empirical studies of security risks in large language models. Together, this work demonstrates how cryptography and computer security can inform policy, defend democratic values, and address global security challenges.

Beyond research, I have worked extensively at the intersection of technology and policy. At the Hoover Institution, I served as a SETR Fellow contributing to reports for Congress and the White House on emerging technologies and national security. Separately, I have advised the White House directly on technology policy.

My work was not done in isolation, and I am deeply grateful to my wonderful coauthors. I encourage you to visit my research page to see their accomplishments.
