Here you can find classes I've taught and talks I've given. This site is currently under construction and some talks are listed with missing slides. These will be updated as the site is finished.

## Teaching
{{< class name="CS 355: Topics in Cryptography" websiteUrl="https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs355/22sp/" description="Stanford students have been behind some of the most important developments in modern cryptography, including Diffie-Hellman key exchange, Merkle trees, ElGamal encryption, and fully homomorphic encryption. With this history in mind, CS355 will cover many of the foundational techniques that you will need to get started with crypto research and to go on to solve the fieldâ€™s great open problems. It will also introduce you to the joy of cryptography research and give you a taste of the lastest developments in cryptography. By the time you finish this course, you should understand the most important cryptographic tools and be able to use them. We will cover basic proof techniques, zero knowledge, multiparty computation, elliptic-curve cryptography, cryptanalysis, privacy, and post-quantum cryptography." role="Instructor" >}}

{{< class name="CS 255: Introduction to Cryptography" websiteUrl="https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/courses/cs255_winter21/" description="Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. This course explains the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to use them correctly." role="Head TA" >}}
