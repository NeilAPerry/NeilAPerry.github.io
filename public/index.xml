      <description>I am a PhD candidate at Stanford University, advised by Professor Dan Boneh. My research lies at the intersection of cryptography, democracy, and national security, with a focus on developing innovative solutions for complex global challenges. My commitment to enhancing free speech and promoting democracy is reflected in my development of an anonymous communication system, designed to support protesters in regimes with limited internet access, and in my creation of new steganographic techniques.</description>

Teaching#  CS 355: Topics in Cryptography Website: https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs355/22sp/
Stanford students have been behind some of the most important developments in modern cryptography, including Diffie-Hellman key exchange, Merkle trees, ElGamal encryption, and fully homomorphic encryption. With this history in mind, CS355 will cover many of the foundational techniques that you will need to get started with crypto research and to go on to solve the fieldâ€™s great open problems.</description>
